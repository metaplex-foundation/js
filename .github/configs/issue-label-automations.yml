    Hi @{issue-author},


    Thank you for your question!


    We'd like to make sure our GitHub issue tracker remains the best place to 
    manage issues that affect the development of the Metaplex JS SDK itself.


    Your question deserve a purpose-built Q&A forum like StackOverflow so it is 
    more searchable and encourages others to contribute to and benefit from the answer.


    Unless there exists evidence that this is a bug with the JS SDK itself, would you 
    **please post your question to the Solana Stack Exchange** using the following link:


    **[https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=metaplex](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/ask?tags=metaplex)**


    If you could please share the link to the newly create question here afterwards, that would be very helpful for anyone following this thread.
